# Contributing to Agent OS

Thanks for considering a contribution! Agent OS is free and open source, but to keep things manageable we follow a **Discussions-first workflow**.

---

## Where things go

- **Discussions (Bugs):** Report suspected bugs.  
  👉 **Check the docs before posting:** [buildermethods.com/agent-os](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os)  
  Maintainers may promote confirmed bugs into Issues.

- **Discussions (Ideas):** Share feature ideas and proposals.  
  👉 **Check the docs first** to ensure it’s not already supported.

- **Discussions (Q&A):** Ask “how do I…?” questions.  
  👉 **Check the docs first** to avoid duplicates and find quick answers.  
  This is community-supported only.

- **Builder Methods Pro:** Paid membership with guaranteed support → https://buildermethods.com/pro

## Pull Requests (read first!)

To avoid wasted effort and to protect maintainer time:

- **Bug-fix PRs:**  
  Must link to a Discussion that was promoted to an **Issue** labeled `bug` and still open.

- **Feature PRs:**  
  Must link to a Discussion explicitly labeled **`approved`** by a maintainer.  
  > ⚠️ New features are **rarely accepted into core**, even if well-structured and tested. We must consider long-term maintenance and backward/future compatibility.  
  > We encourage ideas in Discussions, especially those with clear, widely useful use-cases and tangible improvements over today’s behavior.

- **Docs-only PRs:**  
  Typos, clarifications, and doc improvements are welcome and do **not** require prior approval.

PRs that don’t meet these requirements will be **auto-closed by our bot**.

## How to propose a feature (RFC)

Open a Discussion in **Ideas** with:  
- Problem & motivation  
- Proposed change & alternatives  
- UX/devex impact  
- Migration/compatibility considerations  

If a maintainer labels it **`approved`**, then a PR may be opened.
