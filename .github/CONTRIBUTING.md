# Contributing to Agent OS

Thanks for considering a contribution!

## What goes where
- **Issues:** Reproducible bugs only.
- **Discussions (Ideas):** New features or integration requests and other ideas.
- **Discussions (Q&A):** “How do I…?” questions and community help.
- **Official support:** https://buildermethods.com/pro

## Pull Requests (read first)
To avoid churn and protect maintainer time, **PRs must meet at least one of:**
1) Link to a **Discussion** that a maintainer labeled **`approved`**, or  
2) Link to an **open Issue** labeled **`bug`**.

PRs that do not meet the above are auto-closed by our bot.

Even well-structured, tested, and documented **new features are rarely accepted into core**. Beyond roadmap fit, we must consider long-term maintenance and backward/future compatibility. We still **encourage ideas**—especially those with clear, widely useful use-cases and tangible improvement over today’s behavior. Please start those in **Discussions (Ideas)**.

## How to propose a feature (RFC)
Open a Discussion (Ideas) outlining:
- Problem & motivation
- Proposed change & alternatives
- User experience impact
- Migration/compat guidance
  
A maintainer may label the discussion **`approved`** if it's aligned. Only then are new feature PRs welcomed.

## Bug-fix PRs
Bug-fix PRs linked to an open **`bug`** Issue are welcomed. Please include testing instructions when feasible.  Also propose updates to docs if behavior changes.

## Docs improvements
PRs that fix typos/clarify docs are welcome and do **not** require an `approved` Discussion or `bug` Issue.
