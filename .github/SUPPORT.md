# Support policy

Agent OS is free and open source. To keep it sustainable, we split **support** into two paths:

- **Community support (free):**  
  Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os/discussions) in the **Q&A** category. Anyone is welcome to ask questions and share answers. Maintainers may occasionally reply, but there is **no guarantee**.

- **Official support (paid):**  
  For guaranteed responses from Brian & team, join **Builder Methods Pro**:  
  ðŸ‘‰ https://buildermethods.com/pro

## Bugs
Suspected bugs should be posted in the **Bugs category** of Discussions.  
Maintainers may promote confirmed bugs to Issues for tracking and fixes.

---

## Feature ideas
Use the **Ideas category** of Discussions to propose and upvote feature requests. Only ideas explicitly marked `approved` by maintainers may later be implemented in core.
