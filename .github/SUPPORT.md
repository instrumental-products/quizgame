# Support policy

This is free and open source. To keep the project sustainable and my time focused, we separate **bugs**, **ideas**, and **support**:

- **Bugs (Issues):** Use GitHub Issues **only** for reproducible bugs. Provide steps, environment, and logs.
- **Ideas & “How do I…?” (Discussions):** Use GitHub Discussions to propose features, ask general questions, and upvote ideas.
- **Official support (paid):** For setup help, debugging, and guaranteed responses from me, join **Pro** (community chat, forum, workshops, courses, and official Agent OS support).
