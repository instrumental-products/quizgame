# Support policy

We separate **bugs**, **ideas**, and **support** to keep the project healthy:

- **Bugs (Issues):** Use GitHub Issues **only** for reproducible bugs with steps/logs.
- **Ideas / Feature requests:** Use **Discussions (Ideas)** so others can upvote and add context.
- **Questions / Community support:** Use **Discussions (Q&A)** for ‚Äúhow do I‚Ä¶?‚Äù.
- **Official support (guaranteed):** Join **Builder Methods Pro** for guaranteed responses from Brian & team.
