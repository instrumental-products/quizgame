# Support policy

Agent OS is free and open source. To keep it sustainable, we split **support** into two paths:

- **Community support (free):**  
  Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os/discussions) in the **Q&A** category.  
  ðŸ‘‰ **Before posting, check the official docs:** [buildermethods.com/agent-os](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os)  
  Maintainers may occasionally reply, but there is **no guarantee**.

- **Official support (paid):**  
  For guaranteed responses from Brian & team, join **Builder Methods Pro**:  
  ðŸ‘‰ https://buildermethods.com/pro

## Bugs
- Post suspected bugs in the **Bugs category** of Discussions.  
- ðŸ‘‰ **Before posting, check the docs:** [buildermethods.com/agent-os](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os)  
- Maintainers may promote confirmed bugs to Issues for tracking and fixes.

## Feature ideas
Use the **Ideas category** of Discussions to propose and upvote feature requests.  
Only ideas explicitly marked `approved` by maintainers may later be implemented in core.
