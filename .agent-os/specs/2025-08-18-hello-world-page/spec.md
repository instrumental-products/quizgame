> Spec: Hello World Page
> Created: 2025-08-18

## Overview

Create a simple hello world landing page that displays "Hello World" message to logged-in users. This provides a basic authenticated landing page for users after they log in to the quiz platform.

## User Stories

### Basic Welcome Page

As a logged-in user, I want to see a welcome message when I access the main page, so that I know I've successfully logged in and reached the platform.

The user logs in through a simple session-based authentication system and is redirected to a landing page that displays "Hello World" with their name.

## Spec Scope

1. **Welcome Page Display** - Show "Hello World" message to authenticated users
2. **Basic Authentication Check** - Require user to be logged in to access the page
3. **Simple Routing** - Set up root path to show the hello world page for logged-in users
4. **Minimal Layout** - Use application layout with basic Tailwind styling

## Out of Scope

- Complex authentication features (password reset, email verification)
- User registration functionality
- Dashboard navigation or menu systems
- Quiz-related functionality on this page

## Expected Deliverable

1. Logged-in users can visit the root path and see "Hello World" message
2. Non-logged-in users are redirected to a login page
3. Page uses basic application layout with Tailwind CSS styling
