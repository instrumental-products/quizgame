## The Problem

### Limited Analytics in Educational Assessment

Most existing quiz platforms provide basic scoring but lack detailed analytics on question performance, difficulty analysis, and learning patterns. This makes it difficult for educators to identify which concepts students struggle with most and optimize their teaching accordingly.

**Our Solution:** QuizGame provides comprehensive question-level analytics, difficulty scoring, and detailed performance tracking to help educators make data-driven improvements to their teaching.

### Fragmented User Experience

Many quiz platforms separate quiz creation, taking, and analytics into different interfaces, creating a disjointed experience for educators who need to manage the entire assessment lifecycle.

**Our Solution:** QuizGame integrates quiz creation, delivery, and analytics into a unified platform with role-based access for seamless workflow management.
