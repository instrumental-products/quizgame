# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

# Create a test user for development
User.find_or_create_by!(email: "test@example.com") do |user|
  user.name = "Test User"
  user.password = "password123"
  user.password_confirmation = "password123"
  user.role = "user"
end

User.find_or_create_by!(email: "admin@example.com") do |user|
  user.name = "Admin User"
  user.password = "password123"
  user.password_confirmation = "password123"
  user.role = "admin"
end

puts "Created test users:"
puts "  Email: test@example.com, Password: password123"
puts "  Email: admin@example.com, Password: password123"
